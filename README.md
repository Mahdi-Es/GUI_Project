## *Edit_Text*  
this project:
1. In the Change text section, write a text and press Enter to display it in JLabel.
2. At the top of the project, there are three JRadioButtons that we can enlarge or reduce the font of the text, and we can also place the text on the left, right or center of the JLabel.
3. In the Font Option section, we can make the text Bold or Italic, and we can apply both of these to the text at the same time.
4. In the Foreground section, we can choose the color of the text.
5. In the Background section, we can choose the background color.
